# Instaclone
## Description
Made with the MERN stack, Instaclone is full-stack, content-driven, web app with the intention of emulating Instaclone. Users are authenticated and allowed to upload images to the database. From there users can browse all of the uploaded pictures

## Disclaimer
This is not the original project. The original project was a capstone of a coding bootcamp with 3 other contributors (see below).
The original project, however, was left in an imperfect state. I have merely copied the files so I could work on it myself without having to disturb the owner of the repository for pull request approval.

The only things I'm changing on this repo are tweaks to get the site hosted functionally on heroku. Beyond that, I do not take full credit for this project. While I did do some API routes and some front-end functionality, the whole project was a team effort and credit where credit is due.
